A simple **Flappy Bird** clone built using **Godot 4.5**, created for the **"Programming Languages and Paradigms"** seminar at **UZH** (2025). The project is used to introduce **GDScript** to other students.

## Prerequisites
Download the Godot Engine from the [official website](https://godotengine.org/download/) or via [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/404790/Godot_Engine/).

## Installation
To run the project locally using Godot:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone git@github.com:dreamfarer/godot-pacman-exercise.git
   ```
2. Open Godot, click **Import**, and select the project folder containing `project.godot`.

## Credits
The original Flappy Bird clone was created by [Hernandez712](https://github.com/Hernandez712). I adapted it for the purpose of introducing GDScript to other students.
